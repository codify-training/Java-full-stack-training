Java Intro:
----------------
Imagine this.

You wake up in the morning.
Your alarm rings.
You unlock your phone.
Order breakfast.
Travel to office.
Attend online meetings.
Swipe your card.
Watch a movie at night.

You just used Java… without writing a single line of it.

Why does world trust Java?
Stable - Systems runs for years without crashing.
Secure - Java has security layers that cant be break easily
Scalable - Even your app/website traffic goes from 10 users to a million users, Java has good features to handles your app work smoothly. 
Portable - Write once and run anywhere.


Smartphones: 
  All your apps in IOS or Android uses java.
Banks & Financial systems: 
   t/f money, swiping a card, processing some transaction ex. NEFT.
Airlines and Railways: 
   Ticket booking, seat allocation, reservations, feedback systems.
Smart Devices & Tv's:
   smart TV's or android TV's, barcode scanners.
Cars & IOT:
   Self driving cars & music systems.

Java lives in all these places.

Java Origin
--------------
Java was borin early 1990 - sunmicrosystems
Developed - James Goslings
their originnal goal was to build -= settop boxes, Tv's and smart devices.

1995 - when internet was boomed, then OAK was broght back and renamed it to java.


Features of java:
----------------
1) Platform independent -
--------------------
   Write once, run anywhere.
Java Dont talk directly to the hardware. The compiler creates bytecode and we give this to JVM.

2) Object Oriented:
----------------
Java elimimates confusion in the developers and helps to write clean code.

class - ex: blueprint of house .
Object - EX: actual house
Method
Variabe

Rules:
------
Encapsulation 
Inheritence 
Polymorphism
Abstraction

If you understand these rules and follow them you can write clean and maintainable code.  

3) Garbage Collection:
------------------
In old languages the developer have to go and free up the memory.
In Java you write logic, JVM will tke care of cleaning up the memory. 

No memory tension, full peace.

4) Secure
----------
Java is very strict
No direct access to the memory.
Code is verified before running.

5) Performance:
---------------
In Java there is JIT compiler, java learns which code runs frequently and optimizes them on the fly.
Java hoptspots - this is the place where the frequesntly ran code will be hold.


6) Multithreading:
-------------------
points - 5secs
products - 7secs
wishlist - 5sec
cart - 5secs
----------------
Total - 22secs
----------------

I will start 4 threads, 
thread1 - points,
thread2 products, 
thread3 - wihslist, 
thread 4 - cart
-------------------------------------------------------
All the threads execution starts at same time, 7 secs.


7) Backward Compatabilty:
---------------------------
Java promises - I wll support your old code.
Java 8 still works today in the current version of java25.
Because of this (BC) java is running for many yeas and is gaining the trust of huge organizations. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------
Hellworld program
class HelloWorld
   Defines class named HelloWorld
   In java everything goes inside the class

 public static void main(String[] args)
      public - JVM will access this method.
      main - 
        Java starts execution from main
        Without main program wont run.
      void - return type
          Returns nothing.
      static - 
         Without creating object JVM can access this method.

String[] args
     Used to receive command line argument.
     to pass argument from command line ex: java ClassName arg1 arg2 arg3

System.out.println("Hello World")
  System - Build in class
  out - output stream
  println - print line

To compile - javac Filename.java
  Once we compile a java file we get .class file.
To Run - java ClassName
to pass args from command line ex: java ClassName arg1 arg2 arg3
  Accessing them 
      System.out.println("arg 0 : "+ args[0]);
      System.out.println("arg 1 : "+ args[1]);
      System.out.println("arg 2 : "+ args[2]);

Class 
  A class is blueprint or template.
   -> it defines what data an object will have and what action it can perform.
   ->  Class does not occupy memory by itself.
   class Car{
      //data, variables, properties
      String color;
      int speed;
      // Method, function, behaviour
      void drive(){
         System.out.println("drive")
      }
      void displayCarProps(){
         int cardecsize = 10;
         System.out.println("Color: "+color + " Speed: "+ speed)
      }
   }

Object:
  An object is instane of class. It respresent real thing created from class.
  Car myCar = new Car();
  myCar - Object  
  new Car() - Using this statement car object will be created.
  Car - It represents type of object.

  myCar.color = "red";
  myCar.speed = 100
  myCar.drive();
  myCar.displayCarProps();

  Car myNewCar = new Car();
  myNewCar.color = "white";
  myNewCar.speed = 200
  myNewCar.drive();
  myNewCar.displayCarProps();


------------------------------------------------

Assessment:
   - HelloWorldProgram - compile and run.
   - Class Bird - 
       properties - weight, height, color.
       Behaviuor - 
          doFly() - print "bird can fly"
          displayBirdProps - print output as --- weight : 100 height : 200cms  color - red

Use 2 bird objects and print the props like Car class i have mentioned.     
           


Varaiables and Methods:
------------------------
Variable: 
    its a box that stores data.

     Syntax -
         datatype name = value;
datatype - this defines which type of data we are keeping in the memory.
name - reference to the data in the memory
value - actual data.


ex: int age = 25;
    String name = "Akshay is ugly guy";
    double salary = 5000.00; 

Types of variables:
----------------------
local variables:
   created and used inside the method.
Instance variables: 
    Created inside a class and outside method. Each object gets its own copy.
static variables: 
    Belongs to class, shared by all objects.

Methods:
---------
    A block of code that can perform some work.
    Method is used to (perform an action) or (perform task/action and return a result) 
  Syntax: 
       returnType methodName(parameters){
         //code
       }

      No return No param
      ----------------------
      ex: void greet(){
         
            System.out.println(Hello");
      }     

      method with paramamters:
      ----------------------------------
         void printName(String name){
            Syste.out.println("My Name is :"+name);
         }
         
         object.printName("Akash");

      method with multiple paramamters and return type :
      --------------------------------------------------------
         int doAdd(int a, int b, int c){
            int d = a + b + c;
            return d;
         }

         int result = doAdd(10, 20, 30);
         sop("result: "+ result);

      ----------------------------------------------------------
      Write 3 classes:
      class VoidNoParamDemo{
         void greet(){
         
            System.out.println(Hello");
      }   

      psvm(){
         VoidNoParamDemo voidNoParamDemo = new VoidNoParamDemo();
         voidNoParamDemo.greet();

      }
      }
      Class Names - VoidNoParamDemo, VoidParamDemo, ReturnResultMultiParamDemo
